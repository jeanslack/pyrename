Description:
------- 

Pyrename is written entirely in python, It uses the command line (cli)
and from the options is also available with sequential numbering. Each 
process is applied separately or renaming the files or folders.


Dependencies:
-------

python >=2.6


Features:
-------
 
Types of renaming consecutively numbered ordered :

* Rename with a name and automatically assigns the numerical order.

* It adds a numerical ordered to the origin names, maintaining the 
alphanumeric order. The source names and extensions are not changed.

* Removes the progressive numbering previously applied with the above methods

Rename with changes in strings methods :

* Change or add certain strings to the names with the same match.
With this option you can also change the file extension, although 
it is encouraged to use the appropriate method (or addext extreplace), 
and you can delete them. 

* Adds strings to the names without any type of match (source names can 
be different for each file or folder), allowing us to determine the 
new string position, that is the beginning or end of the original 
name (but not of 'extension which remains the same).

Extensions renaming methods : 

* Replaces the extensions encountered in a match: the renaming of
extensions is done by entering the extension you want to change in 
a group of files/folders.

* Adds extensions to files/folders who have none. Specifying
the prefix '-f' or 'd' if it determines the outcome for files or folders.
